# Blacket-Tui-Native RS
Cross-platform, *Rust*-based rewrite of Blacket-Tui-Native (which originally used Go).

## FAQ (not really though)
- Why Rust?
  - Rust provided a better developer velocity for us. Rust provides compared to Go:
    - Increased safety
    - Better performance
    - More "native"
    - A larger developer ecosystem (better TUI)
    - A more organized, modular approach to larger programs
    - Decent-ish cross-platform compatibility
- What will happen to the original Blacket-Tui-Native?
  - The Go version of Blacket-Tui-Native will be legacy/retired in favor of the new Rust version.
  - Eventually, this will be merged into the main repository when it can be considered as complete as the original Go edition.
